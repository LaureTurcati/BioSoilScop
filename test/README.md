# README

### Overview
This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of algorithms for detecting insects using a Raspberry Pi equipped with a camera. The project aims at improving detection accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for embedded systems. The algorithms leverage OpenCV functionalities and YOLO-based deep learning models.

### Installation
* Clone the repository
2. Set up a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv detection-algo-env
    source detection-algo-env/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install dependencies: opencv-python should already be there. For YOLO:
    ```bash
    pip3 install ultralytics
    ```
